### Greetings! I'm Sam. ðŸ‘‹

In my free time I write code that I'll never look at again. Programming is my favorite road to discovery when learning new things. My repos here are pretty random and my older repositories are held on an [older account](https://github.com/igknighted) that I don't really use anymore.

Over the years I've worn many hats, including `Linux Systems Administrator`, `Programmer`, and `DevOps Engineer`. My favorite programming languages are Bash, Go, Python, and Javascript; but overall I'm fairly language agnostic. I've used C/C++, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic 6 (and .NET), C#, Java, HTML+CSS (if you want to call those languages) and so many others. While I'm no expert in any one language, navigating systems is a specialty of mine.

Some things I've explored the code of in the past include GTK2, QT, Ruby Shoes, Unity, Unreal Engine, Apache2, Linux Kernel, libnss, and I could go on; but I think this is a good stopping point on this thought.


Lately, I've been diving deep into `Kubernetes` and I have to say it's one of my favorite tools. I find building scalable infrastructure to be a facinating topic.

My goal is to simplify building applications that can run in Kubernetes. I'm maintaining an organization called [Scalable Delivery](https://github.com/scalabledelivery) that provides MIT licensed templates and tools for general use. It's just a passion project that should eventually make it possible for me to be a lazier application developer. The landing for it is probably [/scalabledelivery/kubernetes](https://github.com/scalabledelivery/kubernetes).


Anyways, this is getting pretty long. Thanks for reading! Pull requests and logged issues are always welcome in my repos.

If you wish to contact me, log an issue in [/protosam/protosam](https://github.com/protosam/protosam). 

âš¡ Fun fact: One of my most popular repositories is [/protosam/go-libnss](https://github.com/protosam/go-libnss) and I have no clue why.

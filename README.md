### Greetings! I'm Sam. ðŸ‘‹

In my free time I write code that I'll never look at again. Programming is my favorite road to discovery when learning new things. My repos here are pretty random and my older repositories are held on an [older account](https://github.com/igknighted) that I don't really use anymore.

Over the years I've worn many hats, including `Linux Systems Administrator`, `Programmer`, and `DevOps Engineer`. My favorite programming languages are Bash, Go, Python, and Javascript; but overall I'm fairly language agnostic. I've used C/C++, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic 6 (and .NET), C#, Java, HTML+CSS (if you want to call those languages) and so many others. While I'm no expert in any one language, navigating systems is a specialty of mine.

Some things I've explored the code of in the past include GTK2, QT, Ruby Shoes, Unity, Unreal Engine, Apache2, Linux Kernel, libnss, and I could go on; but I think this is a good stopping point on this thought.

âš¡ As of lately my current goals include the following.
* Developing tools to facilitate rapid development of microservice
* Creating infrastructure solutions
* Tinkering with Kubernetes and other clustering tools
* Simplifying technology for people, not just tech people
